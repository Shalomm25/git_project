# # The for vairable is used for every iteration in a for loop
# for letter in "Giraffe Academy":
#     # for every letter inside giraffe academy I want to do something
#     print(letter)
# # it loops through every letter and outputs each one all the way to the end



# # for range we take the first number as the starting number and the second number is how far we want to go
# for index in range(3, 10):
