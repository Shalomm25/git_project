modules and pip

a module is a python file that we can inport into another python file
taking certain functions from another file to make life easier

for example fileIO
(just in general creating a file that can have useful tools in it can e a good idea to make coding easier down the road)
(google list of python modules so that you can create a useful_tools file)
if you get good at using python modules and get used to finding the right ones will make coding easier

'''

# import useful_tools.# there will be a drop down menu that will show you all of the functions you can import from that file #
# this would be the file we're importing #
# any external python file that will allow you to use for any program

'''


pip

pip is a program that you can use to install python modules

you have to type it in the terminal which is usually where the output of your programs show up

type [pip --version] w/o the brackets in the terminal is where you find out what version you have to download the correct modules

pip allows you to install any built in python module

these packages allow you to write more specific programs that require the packages

to remove the package write [pip uninstall] w/o the brackets in the terminal
