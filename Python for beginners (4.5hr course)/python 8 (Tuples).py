# Tuples
# tuples are immutable which means it can't be changed or modified
# tuples are generally used for data that won't be changed
# unlike lists in which we use [] for creating a list with tuples we use ()


coordinates = (4, 5)

print(coordinates[0])
# will output 4

# This outputs an error because the TUPLE is immutable
# coordinates[1] = 10 
# print(coordinates[1])
