# What are lists and why are they useful

# give is a name (vasriable)
# every element in the list has an index number that starts with zero

# freinds = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim"]

# this line of code is going to only output the first element in the list

# print(freinds[0])

# this allows us to output everything from idex 1

# print(freinds[1:])

# to change a name in the list

# freinds[1] = "Mike"
# print(freinds[1])
